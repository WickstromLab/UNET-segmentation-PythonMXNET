# Blob Segmentation with U-Net
@author: Ali Hashmi
@note: The python script uses MXNET (a modern opensource deep learning framework) to implement U-net (https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net)

The convolutional neural network is trained sufficiently with a training-dataset (consists of images and labels). The network once trained can be applied on an image to get the segmentation mask
